    <p>Second program with JavaScript, a Fahrenheit to Celsius converter. Four lines of code. I need something more challenging.</p>
    <div id="box">

    <h3>Economic Support for Low-Income Persons</h3>
    <p>I wonder who's going to be put under the bus. I hear about these breaks for tenants, for college students, for banks, but where does this money come from. I'm assuming mostly from the tax payers, but I can't imagine that no group of innocent people are going to come off it worse because of these programs. There probably in a minority though, so probably for the better.</p>
    <p>If I were a college student here are the things I'd need:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>food</li>
      <li>shelter</li>
      <li>clothing</li>
      <li>gas or money for public transit</li>
      <li>money for various non-essential but nice to have items</li>
    </ol>
    <p>According to some websites this is the cost per month for these necessities:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>food: $417.97 * average in San Mateo</li>
      <li>rent: $934.00 * cost of average rent at William and Mary, VA within 1 mile</li>
      <li>clothing: $69.00 * average amount spent on clothing</li>
      <li>gas: $368.09 * average American spends on gas monthly</li>
      <li>various non-essentials: $100.00-$500.00 * my own number, guessing what it would cost for soap, online subscriptions, books, etc * for the calculation we shall use $250.00</li>
    </ol>
    <p>= $2,038.97</p>
    <p>$2038.97 - $1,200.00 = $838.97</p>
    <p>Clearly this would go a long way. The question is whether the costs outweigh the benefits. I'm not the one to judge.</p>
