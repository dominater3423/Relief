    <h3>Activity Today</h3>
    <p>Now there is this niche, not so much anymore because of a certain YouTube channel, subset of computer users who enjoy ricing their desktop. The term was originally a term for personalizing your car, but it has been adopted by this group of people to mean making your desktop ascetically pleasing. I can't say I'm knowledgeable enough to count myself among those people, but I mess around with it every once and a while. I was using KDE and I wanted to finally settle down with a tiling window manager. This basically means that all your windows are immediately "tiled" so that there is no left over screen real-estate. These offer a keyboard centric experience, lower resources, and an infinite amount of ways to customize it. Today I have gone and installed i3-gaps and done some customizing of my own. I changed my bar to use polybar, added the programs I wished to auto start, added gaps, and changed some key-bindings. Overall I'm satisfied, chances are I'll stay unless I grow tired of it for some unknown reason. It really is a superior way of interfacing with your computer. It's the evolution of simple window managers. The only downside is the learning-curve and the time investment. This is a very large hurdle which most users, even Linux users, will not cross.</p>
    <h3>Why Gentoo</h3>
    <p>I ask myself this question all the time to myself: Why do I bother with Gentoo. The reason I have ultimatley decided on is the level of control and freedom it offers. It's amazing being able to set use flags, choose package version, and knowing every package that is installed because I was the one who put it there, not some developer. If your going to install this distro though I'd recommend first that you read the handbook, prefer local use flags to global, and don't bother with compiling a custom kernel, use a binary one from the repos. This is because it simply isn't work it since all it does is shorten compile times for the kernel and shave a few seconds off boot, the exception to this being of course if you simply want to learn. A myth I've found is that people tend to over-estimate the amount of time you will compile packages. I mean sure some take hours, looking at webkit and gcc, but those are few and most take only a couple minutes. A positive, at least for me, is that Gentoo doesn't use SystemD. I personally have no real use cases which SystemD would be of benefit to me and I was getting annoyed by having to wait for SystemD to finish shutting down the system. Also, if you fund to be a unix snob, do one thing and one thing well, you'll despise it for not adhering to this philosophy, which I not personally disposed to myself. When it comes down to it too, the main difference you're going to notice when running different distros is the package manager, the rest of the other changes are mostly superficial and aren't distro dependent. Portage is used by FreeBSD and ChromeOS devs as well, so there's that. It's about as good as a package manager you're going to get. Well why use it, simply because it is a joy to use once you learn it.</p>
    <h3>Parental Controls</h3>
    <p>It really bugs me when people censor the internet. All that happens is you keep whoever it is in a fragile bubble, and when that bubble pops they are twice over influenced. It's funny when I find myself getting blocked too, because if I had the choice I'd throw all my devices in the nearest body of water and never look back. Unfortunately that is not how our modern world works, because if you do then you won't be turning your devices off, they will be turning you off. Very ironic. I throughly despise admins who block things supposedly for my own good. It's like, oh really, should I thank you. Then it gets worse when the admins exclude themselves from the restrictions. I simply think they get enjoyment in the fact that they have power over you and to do anything you need to ask for their permission. They then take on an air of superiority because they think their better than you. I'm saying all this because my dad has recently discovered that the router comes with parental restrictions. Now I don't have internet from 9-6 and he's turned on restricted mode that blocks "inappropriate content." Just imagine the absurdity of it, a 50 year old, an Apple user, downloads some app off the app store, which he didn't previously know existed, on his iphone and block my laptop running Gentoo Linux with a tiling window manager. That is like some government banning books on German Idealism from philosophy because they may have had some influence on the NAZIs. Then it's easy enough get around the blocked websites with a VPN, but the paused connection I haven't found a way around. What do they think I'm doing anyway, staying up till 1 masturbating. My only advice when dealing with these types of people is don't talk to them, look at them with obvious disgust, inform them that their sub-human, and don't sit down to rationalize with them. There is a reason why the first rule of dealing with terrorists is not to negociat with this. Also, unashamedly loosen your bonds if you so find a way.</p>
